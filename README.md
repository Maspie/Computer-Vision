#Selfie Processing - 
To achieve the final processed image, I applied the following steps:
 1. Face Smoothing: Detected and smoothed the facial region using a bilateral filter.
 2. Sharpening: Enhanced the image clarity through unsharpmasking.
 3. EdgeDetection: Applied Canny edge detection to highlight key edges
 4. DiffusionEffect: Blurred the edges and added a green tint for a subtle diffusion effect.
